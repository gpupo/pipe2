            <description><![CDATA[An anvil is a basic tool, a block with a hard surface on which another object is struck.
             The block is as massive as it is practical, because the higher the inertia of the anvil, the more efficiently
              it causes the energy of the striking tool to be transferred to the work piece.
               In most cases the anvil is used as a forging tool. Before the advent of modern welding technology, it was a primary tool of metal workers.
The great majority of modern anvils are made from steel, as well as cast iron or a combination of iron and steel.
Because anvils are very ancient tools and were at one time very commonplace, they have acquired symbolic meaning beyond their use as utilitarian objects.
The principle of the anvil also is of particular interest in biology and in ethology; the anvil being in principle one
 of the most basic forms of tool, its application occurs particularly widely in living organisms.]]></description>
